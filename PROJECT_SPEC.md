# Signal Commons Studio - Project Specification

## Goal

Signal Commons Studio is an offline-first browser workspace for community soundscape fieldwork. A field team curates short field recordings, composes a listening route across neighborhood sites, resolves consent and transcript findings, and compares listener scenarios before publishing a study pack.

## Users

- Field researchers catalogue recordings with capture context and audio metadata.
- Route editors arrange clips into a coherent listening route.
- Quality reviewers verify consent notes, transcripts, and listening support.
- Project leads use scenario projections to choose planning preferences.

## Core entities

- `FieldStudy`: title, field area, listening question, publication date, and release state.
- `Recording`: a short sound clip with catalogue ID, source, recording date, file format, capture location, audio specification, signal role, sensitivity, transcript status, and consent status.
- `Site`: a listening-route stop with a research prompt, duration and clip capacity, quiet-playback support, seating availability, and ordered recording IDs.
- `Placement`: assignment of a recording to a site and position in the route.
- `QualityIssue`: a severity-ranked evidence finding linked to a site or clip, with open, in-progress, or resolved state.
- `Snapshot`: a frozen release summary used for local export and comparison.

## Workflows

### 1. Curate the signal library

The user opens the library, searches and filters recordings, adds a recording through a validated editor, and sees it enter the study. Duplicate catalogue IDs, missing titles or capture context, invalid audio specifications, and weak summaries are rejected with field-level messages. The recording is persisted in local storage and becomes available to the route editor.

### 2. Compose and validate a listening route

The user opens the route view, selects an unplaced clip, assigns it to a listening site, changes sequence, and moves clips between sites. The domain engine recalculates site duration, clip utilization, signal-role coverage, and accessibility constraints after every transition. The constraint panel exposes blocking errors and warnings.

### 3. Resolve evidence quality before release

The user opens the quality desk, creates a finding linked to a clip or site, advances it through open, in-progress, and resolved states, and runs a release check. The release engine combines unresolved blockers, featured clip coverage, role coverage, and route validation. A passing study can export a JSON snapshot; a blocked study explains what remains.

### 4. Compare listener scenarios

The user opens the scenario lab and adjusts listening pace, listener count, and accessibility priority. The projection engine recomputes listening duration, comfort, access coverage, and pressure sites without mutating the saved study. The user can explicitly apply a scenario as planning preferences.

### 5. Export a field checklist

The user filters the quality desk by a listening site and downloads a CSV checklist that lists every placed clip in sequence with audio duration and unresolved findings.

## State and rules

- Study state transitions are `draft -> review -> ready`; a blocking change regresses a ready study to `review`.
- Recording catalogue IDs are normalized and unique.
- Every recording must have positive sample rate, duration, and a valid channels or bit depth value.
- A site warns above 80% of listening capacity and blocks above 100%.
- Sensitive clips cannot enter a quiet-playback site without review.
- Featured clips must be assigned to a listening site before release.
- Arrival, texture, voice, and departure signals must all be represented in the route before release.
- Critical consent or editorial findings block release until resolved.
- Scenario calculations are derived UI state and never overwrite the saved study unless explicitly applied.

## Modules and dependency direction

- `app`: application composition, routing, shell, and page entry points.
- `domain`: entities, validation, state transitions, route analysis, release rules, checklist serialization, and scenario projections.
- `state`: reducer, commands, persistence adapter, migrations, seed study, and selectors.
- `features/library`: signal library discovery, filtering, creation, and editing.
- `features/route`: listening-site planning, placement transitions, and constraint feedback.
- `features/quality`: evidence finding lifecycle, field checklist export, release gate, and snapshot export.
- `features/scenarios`: non-mutating listener scenario projection and preference application.
- `components`: shared navigation, forms, dialogs, feedback, metrics, and visual primitives.

## Public interfaces

- Browser routes: `/library`, `/route`, `/quality`, and `/scenarios`.
- `StudyProvider` exposes typed commands and derived state to pages.
- Local persistence key: `signal-commons.workspace.v1`.
- JSON snapshot download: `signal-commons-snapshot-<date>.json`.
- Field checklist download: `signal-commons-route-checklist-<site>-<date>.csv`.

## Validation plan

- TypeScript compilation and Vite production build.
- Vitest tests for recording validation, route constraints, release rules, site checklists, review transitions, and persistence.
- Playwright browser checks for the five user-facing workflows.
- Generic project audit verifies source scale, manifest consistency, and every declared workflow command.

## Intentionally omitted

- Multi-user collaboration and remote synchronization.
- Authentication, server APIs, and cloud storage.
- Continuous audio capture or waveform editing.
- External catalog integrations and geospatial map tiles.
